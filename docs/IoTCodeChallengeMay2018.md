In this code challenge you should create a 2 way SMS app that can be accessed on the Sandbox. The 2 Way SMS App should allow users to send and SMS from their simulator to your short code, and get a simple reply.

### Workflow:
1. User ends an SMS with any content text.
2. You Short code App responds with the Message: "I am a lumberjack. I sleep all night and work all day!"
3. Add to the README.md a small guide of how to access your serive on the Simulator.
4. Ensure your service is accessible online. You can use the free tiers of [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) or [Openshift](https://www.openshift.com/).
